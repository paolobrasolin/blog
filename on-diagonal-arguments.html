    <h1>On diagonal arguments</h1>
    <p>I’m emotionally bound to diagonal arguments (weird, huh?) because that’s how I stumbled upon someone who gestured and made me gaze upon mathematics for the first time.
I’d like to tell you about some of these ideas, all revolutionary in their own right, and how they are shadows of a single encompassing truth.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I will sweep quite a lot of nonobvious stuff under the rug in order not to bog down the causal reader this is written for<sup id="fnref:yeah" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:yeah" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.
I promise not to lie, though!
In a mild attempt to atone I will also mark the most egregious omissions with an ⚠.</p>

<h2 id="cantors-diagonal-argument">Cantor’s diagonal argument</h2>

<p>In 1891 Georg Cantor published<sup id="fnref:Can91" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Can91" class="footnote">2</a></sup> his diagonal argument.
He proved the existence of infinite sets which cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.
More clearly: he proved the existence of sets bigger than the infinite set of natural numbers.
This was the first step which led to the development of the theory of cardinal numbers, a generalization of the natural numbers capable of measuring the size of sets (and the different kinds of infinities they can be).</p>

<p>Let $C$ be the set of infinite sequences of binary digits, i.e. objects like $(0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,\ldots)$.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Given any enumeration $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n, \ldots$ of elements from T, there is an $s\in T$ which corresponds to no $s_n$ in the enumeration.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> Consider an enumeration $s_1, s_2, \ldots$ and build a sequence $s$ such that its $n$th digit is the complementary<sup id="fnref:complementary" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:complementary" class="footnote">3</a></sup> of the $n$th digit of the $n$th sequence in the enumeration:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
  s_1 & = (\mathbf{0},0,0,\ldots) \\
  s_2 & = (1,\mathbf{0},1,\ldots) \\
  s_3 & = (0,1,\mathbf{1},\ldots) \\
  & \vdots \\[.2em]\hline\\[-1em]
  s & = (\mathbf{1},\mathbf{1},\mathbf{0},\ldots) \\
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>By construction, $s$ differs from each $s_n$ in the enumeration since their $n$th digit is different.
Hence, $s$ cannot occur in the sequence. $\blacksquare$</p>

<p>Don’t be fooled by the underwhelming simplicity: this result is important.
Enumerating a set means labeling its elements with natural numbers, so we just proved that no enumeration of $T$ is exhaustive.
In other terms, the correspondence established by no enumeration can be one-to-one.
This means that while we know that the set of natural numbers is infinite, we now also know that $T$ is strictly bigger<sup id="fnref:cardinality" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cardinality" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="the-halting-problem">The Halting problem</h2>

<p>In 1928, amidst a period of fervent debate on the foundations of mathematics, David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann posed<sup id="fnref:Hil28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Hil28" class="footnote">5</a></sup> the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>exhibit an algorithm which takes a statement of a first-order<sup id="fnref:first-order-logic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:first-order-logic" class="footnote">6</a></sup> logic as an input and outputs <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em> according to whether the statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of logic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before answering, the notion of <em>algorithm</em> had to be made precise.
That was done during the 30s by Alonzo Church with his λ-calculus, and then again by Alan Turing with his Turing machines.
The two notions proved to be equivalent models of computation, and during those years the fields of computation and computability theory theory sprung to life with the contribution of many others, <em>well before the construction of the first computer</em><sup id="fnref:predated-pcs" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:predated-pcs" class="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Once the necessary machinery was established, the answer to Hilbert’s request was found to be a resounding <em>no</em>.</p>

<p>A <em>Turing machine</em> (TM for short) is a box<sup>⚠</sup> which maintains and evolves a state by consuming input.
When given an input, it can either <em>halt by accepting</em> the input, <em>halt by rejecting</em> the input, or not halt at all by <em>looping</em> forever in an infinite computation.</p>

<p>A <em>language</em> is a collection of inputs that can be fed to a TM.
A TM is said to <em>recognize</em> a language if it accepts all its inputs, and either rejects or never halts on inputs not in the language.
A TM is said to <em>decide</em> a language if it accepts all inputs in the language and rejects all inputs not in the language.</p>

<p>Intuitively, saying that a TM decides a language means that it is always able to give an answer to the problem represented by the language.</p>

<p>Given an <em>encoding</em> $\langle-\rangle$ which maps things<sup>⚠</sup> to an input the machine can recognize, we can write the Halting problem as a language encoding all pairs composed by machines and inputs on which they halt:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
H = \left\{ \left\langle M, x \right\rangle \vert \mathrm{\ Turing\ machine\ } M \mathrm{\ halts\ on\ input\ } x \right\}
$$</div>

<p>If a TM is able to decide $H$ it means that it’s able to determine whether any possible TM halts on any possible input.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> No Turing machine<sup id="fnref:that-depends" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:that-depends" class="footnote">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:that-really-depends" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:that-really-depends" class="footnote">9</a></sup> can decide $H$.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> 
Suppose there exists a TM $A$ that decides $H$.
Consider a TM B constructed<sup>⚠</sup> as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$B$ halts on $\langle p\rangle$ if $A$ rejects $\langle p, \langle p\rangle\rangle$;</li>
  <li>$B$ loops on $\langle p\rangle$ if $A$ accepts $\langle p, \langle p\rangle\rangle$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the two possible behaviours of $A$ on $\langle B,\langle B\rangle\rangle$:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if $A$ accepts $\langle B,\langle B\rangle\rangle$ then
    <ul>
      <li>$B$ must halt on $\langle B\rangle$ by definition of $A$,</li>
      <li>$B$ must loop on $\langle B\rangle$ by definition of $B$;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>if $A$ rejects $\langle B,\langle B\rangle\rangle$ then
    <ul>
      <li>$B$ must loop on $\langle B\rangle$ by definition of $A$,</li>
      <li>$B$ must halt on $\langle B\rangle$ by definition of $B$.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases we derive a contradiction from the construction of $B$.
Hence, $A$ cannot exist. $\blacksquare$</p>

<p>This proof was also relatively simple to follow.
But… what does it have to do with the Cantor’s diagonal argument?</p>

<p>TMs can be enumerated<sup id="fnref:enumerable-tm" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:enumerable-tm" class="footnote">10</a></sup>, so given any pair $M_i$ and $M_j$ we can build a table presenting whether the first halts when given the second is encoded and fed to it as an input.
That is, whether $\langle M_i, \langle M_j\rangle\rangle \in H$ or in other words how $A$ acts on a certain subset of $H$:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{matrix}
& \langle M_1\rangle & \langle M_2\rangle & \langle M_3\rangle & \ldots \\
M_1 & \mathrm{\textbf{accepts}} & \mathrm{accepts} & \mathrm{accepts} & \ldots \\
M_2 & \mathrm{rejects} & \mathrm{\textbf{accepts}} & \mathrm{rejects} & \ldots \\
M_3 & \mathrm{accepts} & \mathrm{rejects} & \mathrm{\textbf{rejects}} & \ldots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots \\[.2em]\hline\\[-1em]
B & \mathrm{\textbf{loops}} & \mathrm{\textbf{loops}} & \mathrm{\textbf{halts}} & \ldots \\
\end{matrix}
$$</div>

<p>Juxtaposing $B$ to the table, it becomes noticeable how it has been built as a “complementary of the diagonal”.
Furthermore, the previous proof essentially states $B$ cannot occur in the enumeration.
This looks very much like a generalization of Cantor’s technique.</p>

<p>What the hell is going on?</p>

<h2 id="gödels-first-incompleteness-theorem">Gödel’s First incompleteness theorem</h2>

<p>We only mentioned Hilbert’s Entscheidungsproblem, but it is just the last of the three question he recast in 1928 freshening some of the famous <em>23 Hilbert Problems</em> posed three decades earlier:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Is mathematics complete? I.e. can any statement be proved or disproved from the axioms?</li>
  <li>Is mathematics consistent? I.e. does any provable statement exist such that its negation is provable too?</li>
  <li>Is mathematics decidable?</li>
</ol>

<p>We now know how the last one was answered.
However – brace yourself – that result was informed by the work Gödel did on the first two questions a few years before.
In 1931 Gödel stated<sup id="fnref:God31" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:God31" class="footnote">11</a></sup> the result known as the <em>First incompleteness theorem</em>.
The details are pretty technical, so we’ll just sketch this result.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem sketch.</strong><sup>⚠⚠</sup> Any consistent formal system within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete (i.e. there are statements of its language which can neither be proved nor disproved).</p>

<p><em>Proof sketch.</em><sup>⚠⚠</sup> The proof is composed of three steps: arithmetization of syntax, construction of the provability statement, and diagonalization.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Expressions of the formal system can enumerated by a mapping to natural numbers called <em>Gödel numbering</em>. Thanks to this, proving properties of expressions (e.g. falsehood) is equivalent to proving properties of numbers.</li>
  <li>Build an expression meaning “statement $S$ is provable in the system” which can be applied to any statement $S$.</li>
  <li>Use the diagonalization technique to build the <em>Gödel sentence</em>, a self-referential expression meaning it itself is unprovable.
Assuming the system is consistent, show the <em>Gödel sentence</em> is unprovable thus demonstrating the system is not complete. By <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> the system cannot be consistent.
$\blacksquare$</li>
</ol>

<p>Provided you forgive me for skimping on details, you should now be seeing a general pattern which underlies all examples up to this point.</p>

<p>In fact, Gödel’s main technical insights were the first two steps.
The punchline itself really is one of many diagonalization arguments in math, all alike in structure.</p>

<p>This trail we are following, where does it lead?</p>

<h2 id="lawveres-fixed-point-theorem">Lawvere’s Fixed point theorem</h2>

<p>There are many results akin to the ones mentioned above, and various generalizations which historically elucidated their similarities.
There is also absolutely no hope for me to do any justice to them or the minds which produced them.</p>

<p>Therefore, I will yield now and simply point to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow:
all previous results are instances of the <em>Fixed point theorem</em> Lawvere presented<sup id="fnref:Law69" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Law69" class="footnote">12</a></sup> in 1969.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>. For any cartesian closed category, if there exists a point-surjective morphism<sup id="fnref:where-is-diag" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:where-is-diag" class="footnote">13</a></sup> $\phi\colon A\to B^A$, then every morphism $f\colon B\to B$ has a fixed point $s\colon 1 \to B$.</p>

<p>It is definitely not a <em>complex</em> result, but understanding it requires a nontrivial amount of math.
Luckily, we can <del>butcher</del> rephrase it vaguely enough to feel how it may subsume the previous results:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>For any cartesian closed category,</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In any setting (populated by the objects of our study) with enough structure to host a logic which models our intuitive notion of computation,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>if there exists a point-surjective morphism $\phi\colon A\to B^A$,</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>given two objects $A$ and $B$, if there exist a way to attribute an element of $A$ to every map from $A$ to $B$,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>then every morphism $f\colon B\to B$ has a fixed point $s\colon 1 \to B$.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>then every map $f$ from $B$ to itself has a fixed point (i.e. an element $x$ of $B$ such that $f(x)=x$).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can also easily apply the theorem’s obverse to obtain negative results: if we can present an $f$ with no fixed point then such a $\phi$ cannot exists.
Let’s consider Cantor’s diagonal argument once again and do just that.</p>

<p>The infinite sequences we studied are secretly elements of $\mathbf{2}^\mathbb{N}$, i.e. maps from $\mathbb{N}$ (natural numbers) to $\mathbf{2}$ (binary digits) which map $n$ to the $n$th digit of the sequence.
The exhaustive enumeration of sequences we postulated the existence of is exactly a map $\phi\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathbf{2}^\mathbb{N}$. However, it’s easy to present a map $f\colon\mathbf{2}\to\mathbf{2}$ which has no fixed point: the map sending a binary digit to its complementary. Therefore $\phi$ cannot exist. QED.</p>

<p>All three negative results presented above, i.e.</p>
<ul>
  <li>uncountability from Cantor’s diagonal lemma,</li>
  <li>undecidability from the Halting problem, and</li>
  <li>incompleteness from Gödel’s first theorem</li>
</ul>

<p>can all be cast as consequences of Lawvere’s Fixed point theorem obverse.
Along with these, many other results both positive and negative can be seen under this same angle.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Each of the mentioned results revolutionized math in its own way, planting ideas which grew into whole new branches.
This didn’t come without some human downsides: oftentimes those ideas have been shrouded by an esoteric and mysterious aura.
Lawvere<sup id="fnref:Law08" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Law08" class="footnote">14</a></sup> himself clearly underlined that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In <em>Diagonal arguments and Cartesian closed categories</em> we demystified the incompleteness theorem of Gödel and the truth-definition theory of Tarski by showing that both are consequences of some very simple algebra in the Cartesian-closed setting. It was always hard for many to comprehend how Cantor’s mathematical theorem could be re-christened as a “paradox” by Russell and how Gödel’s theorem could be so often declared to be the most significant result of the 20th century. There was always the suspicion among scientists that such extra-mathematical publicity movements concealed an agenda for re-establishing belief as a substitute for science. Now, one hundred years after Gödel’s birth, the organized attempts to harness his great mathematical work to such an agenda have become explicit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, let the pragmatic optimism of Yanofsky<sup id="fnref:Yan03" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Yan03" class="footnote">15</a></sup> be the last quote. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best part of this unified scheme is that it shows that there are really no paradoxes. There are limitations. Paradoxes are ways of showing that if you permit one to violate a limitation, then you will get an inconsistent systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I on the other hand have written nearly nothing,
tracing just broad strokes across centuries of efforts
to share with you my amazement at both the minglings of history
and the clarity humans are capable of reaching.</p>

<p>Hopefully that’s enough to make your curious,
or at the very least angry at the lack of details,
which for many purposes is equivalent.</p>
